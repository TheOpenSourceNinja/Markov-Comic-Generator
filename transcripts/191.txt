//Decided to take sentences that were originally spread over multiple word bubbles and write them here as if they were not. Thus the repetition.
M: MY HELMET MAKES ME FEEL *SAFE* IN A SCARY WORLD.
E: MY RELIGION MAKES ME FEEL *SAFE* IN A SCARY WORLD.
M: EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO *PROOF* THAT HELMETS REDUCE INJURY
E: EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO *PROOF* THAT GOD EXISTS
M: YOU *SHOULD* WEAR A HELMET.
E: YOU *SHOULD* CONÂ­VERT.
