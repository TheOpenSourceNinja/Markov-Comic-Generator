The TrueType font files in this folder are not part of the this project. I (James Dearing) am uploading them here for your convenience so that you will have bold and non-bold versions of at least one comic font. The font is by Nina Paley and is based on her handwriting. I torrented this font from https://archive.org/details/NinaPaleyFonts .
