# Purposes of this project
The main point of this project is to create transcripts that will work with [Markov Comic Generator](https://github.com/dearingj/Markov-Comic-Generator). That is not all, though: I made this a separate repository on GitHub because the transcription of dialog and the erasing of it from the images should ease translation and other recycling of this part of our culture.

For an example of what results when these transcripts are used with Markov Comic Generator, see [Mimi and Markov](https://www.theopensource.ninja/category/mimi-and-markov/).

# File formats and organization
See the Markov Comic Generator program's readme for descriptions of the file formats used.

# Note about word bubbles
These files don't necessarily have to correspond with a comic's actual visible word bubbles. Not all comics have visible bubbles at all. These files actually define rectangular areas in which text can be put.
