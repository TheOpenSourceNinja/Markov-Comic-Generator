# Nina Improved
A modification of the [Nina](https://archive.org/details/NinaPaleyFonts) font family with added glyphs

## Why does this repository exist?
Because I was using the original Nina font for my [Mimi and Eunice transcripts](https://github.com/dearingj/Mimi-and-Eunice-transcripts) and [Markov Comic Generator](https://github.com/dearingj/Markov-Comic-Generator) projects, and I found it to be lacking a few symbols.

## What improvements will be made?
So far, I'm only planning on adding the small number of glyphs which are used in Nina Paley's Mimi and Eunice comics (and thus my Mimi and Eunice transcripts) and are not already present in the existing fonts.
